# Notations
# The misclassification model of a categorical variable is defined as a K by K matrix, mis_prob.
# Let p_ij = P(C*=i|C=j) denote the elements of the matrix. i=1,...K and j=1,...,K.
# To generate C from C*, (K-1)*K parameters needed to be specified.
# Let n_i denote the number of C=i which is unknown and m_i denote the number of C*=i which is known. 
# Let n_ij denote the number of (C*=i, C=j). Let N denote the total number of observations.
# Define q_ij = P(C=i|C*=j)
